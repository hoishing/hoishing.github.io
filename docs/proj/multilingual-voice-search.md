## Motivation

Google voice search in browser pre-determined the language for you based on your OS, location, and google account settings. For instance, I can't search in Cantonese if I'm located in Taiwan using and an English OS...

This extension simply allow us to explicitly choose the language before making voice searches. So you are not bounded by the location, OS, or google account language settings anymore.
