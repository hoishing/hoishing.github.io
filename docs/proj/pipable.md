> pipe operation in python

ğŸ”— [source code](https://github.com/hoishing/pipable)

## Quick Start

### Create the Pipe Object

- instantiate with the `Pipe` class

```python
from pipable import Pipe

list = Pipe(list)
"abc" | list    # ["a", "b", "c"]
```

#### Pipe Object is Partial with Infix Operator

- at the core Pipe create partial function while overriding it's `|` operator
- instantiate Pipe object like the built-in `functools.partial`
- preceding output will be assigned to the last positional argument of the Pipe object

```python
square = Pipe(pow, exp=2)
3 | square    # 9
```

Since that Pipe appends preceding output to the last positional argument,
assigning 1st argument with keyword will raise exception.
This behave the same as `functools.partial`

```python
base2 = Pipe(pow, 2)  # positional arg ok
3 | base2    # 8

base2 = Pipe(pow, base=2)  # keyword arg don't
3 | base2    # raise!!
```

### Using Decorator

- `@Pipe` decorator transforms function into Pipe object
- preceding output will be assigned to the last positional argument
- instantiate Pipe decorated function similar to creating partial

```python
# only one argument
@Pipe
def hi(name: str) -> str:
  return f"hi {name}"

"May" | hi    # "hi May"


# multiple arguments
@Pipe
def power(base: int, exp: int) -> int:
  return a ** b

# instantiate Pipe obj by partially calling the function
2 | power(3)        # 9, note we need to use positional argument here
2 | power(exp=3)    # 8, subsequent arguments can use keyword

# assign the 1st argument with keyword will raise exception
2 | power(base=3)    # raise !!
```

### Passing Variable Length Arguments

- use `>>` operator to pass-in var length arguments

```python
@Pipe
def kebab(*args):
    return "-".join(args)

["a", "b"] >> kebab   # "a-b"
```

- use `<<` operator to pass var length keyword arguments

```python
@Pipe
def concat(**kwargs):
    return ", ".join([f"{k}-{v}" for k, v in kwargs.items()])

dict(b="boy", c="cat") << concat    # "b-boy, c-cat"
```

## Motivation

Pipe operation is a handy feature in functional programming. It allows us to:

- write more succinct and readable code
- create less variables
- easily create new function by chaining other functions

However it's still a missing feature in Python as of 2023. This package try to mimic pipe operation by overriding the bitwise-or operator, and turn any function into pipable partial.

There are packages, such as [pipe] take the similar approach. It works great with iterables, and create pipe as iterator, ie. open pipe). However, I simply want to take preceding expression as an input argument of the current function then execute it, ie. close pipe. It leads to the creation of this package.

## FAQ

How can I assign value to the first argument?
  
Assign it within a wrapper function

```python
square = Pipe(lambda x: pow(x, 2))
3 | square  # 9
```

---

Can I create open pipe?

`Pipe` only create closed pipe, ie. execute the function after piping with the `|` operator. You may consider other solutions such as:

- [pipe], which create open pipe for iterators
- [Coconut], a python variant that embrace functional programming

---

Can I append the preceding output at the beginning of the argument list?

Put the preceding output as the 1st argument of a wrapper function

```python
# prepend is the default behaviour
def kebab(*args):
  return "-".join(*args)

'a' | Pipe(kebab, 'b', 'c')  # 'b c a'

@Pipe
def wrapper(first, others):
  return kebab(first, *others)

'a' | wrapper(others=['b', 'c'])  # 'a b c'
```
