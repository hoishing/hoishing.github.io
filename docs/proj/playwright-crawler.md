## motivation

After three consecutive years of drought, most of Taiwan's reservoirs have nearly run dry. Many counties and cities in the south have implemented corresponding water conservation measures. Fortunately, this summer, Taiwan finally welcomed a wet rainy season. With the continuous rainfall from the plum rains and typhoons, the water levels in Taiwan's reservoirs have been steadily rising. I wanted to know the latest reservoir levels as soon as possible, so I wrote this small program to easily track the water situation in the reservoirs.
