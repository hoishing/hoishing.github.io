## Motivation

In 2010, I stumbled upon an audio clip on the web by [Master Chin Kung (æ·¨ç©ºæ³•å¸«)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_Kung) with the topic "Understanding Buddhism". I felt quite enlightening with it, so continued a dozen more audio lectures from him about buddhism.

As I thought the audio contents might benefits those want to know more about buddhism, and they are free to share, I wrote this app to share those audio clips in the Apple app store.

## Current Status

The app is now obsoleted and the audio files are moved to [internet archive].
